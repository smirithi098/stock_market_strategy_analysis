Dywaz0H7U84,"Hello everyone, welcome to Tradeline. In today's video, I want to share a simple and very profitable strategy that uses the combination of three of the most popular and free indicators. It's a simple strategy, but in order to use it successfully and profitably, you must consider several important factors, which I will explain in this video. So be sure to watch the full video to make sure you don't miss anything.  Before we go any further, if you want to show us your support and help us produce a lot of new content, make sure you hit the Subscribe button and the notification Bell. It's only two clicks, but it means a lot to us. Additionally, I would like to point out that you can apply this strategy to a wide range of asset classes, including Forex, stocks, cryptos, and indices, in any time frame.  So without further ado, let's get started with today's video. As usual, I am using Tradingu.com for our technical analysis, and we're about to set up three indicators. Alright, so now let's add our indicators to our chart. To add indicators here, we click the indicator menu at the top, and in the search menu, type our first indicator's name, which is the stochastic RSI, and we're going to use this one here. Click on it to add it to the chart.  Like the RSI, stochastic RSI cycles between overbought levels above 80 and oversold levels below 20. The stochastic RSI reaches these levels much more frequently than the RSI, as a result of which it provides more trading opportunities. It moves within the range of 0 to 100. Now, how this indicator works: a Buy Signal would be generated when the stochastic RSI falls below the oversold level 20 and then moves back above it. Conversely, a sell signal would be generated when the stochastic RSI rises above the overbought level 80 and then crosses it to the downside. Of course, one should use a longer-term trend filter to ensure that you only take trades in the direction of the trend. In this strategy, we will use two exponential moving averages to ensure the direction of the trend.  Alright, so go to the indicators, type EM in the search box, and then add it to the chart. For this EMA, we must change the settings. So go to the indicator settings and change the length from 9 to 50. And in the style section, I'm going to make it a little thicker so that we can see it clearly. We must add another EMA to our chart. So go to the indicators again, type EM in the search box, and then add it to the chart. For this EMA, we must also change the settings. So go to the indicator settings and change the length from 9 to 100. And in the style section, I'm going to change it to Yellow. You can choose any color you want.  After successfully placing all of these trading indicators on your trading chart, let's see how to use them. Let's start with the rules for entering short positions. So here are the conditions for entering a short trade. First, the 50-period moving average must be below the 100-period moving average. Moreover, both moving averages should be sloping downward. Second, the stochastic RSI should cross the 80 level to the downside, indicating a sell signal. And finally, the price action must be closed below the 50-period moving average. All the rules are met on this candle, so this is the candle where we will enter the trade. We will open a short order at the open of the next candle. You can set a stop loss on either the 50-period moving average line or the most recent swing high, depending on which is closest to the entry candle. And our first target will be at the recent swing low. Let's look at some examples to help you understand.  Here, the 50 EMA is below the 100 EMA, and they are sloped downwards. And here, the stochastic RSI crossed the 80 level to the downside, indicating a sell signal, and the price is also closed below the 50 EMA. All the rules are met on this candle. We will open a short order at the open of the next candle, and I set the stop loss at the 50-period EMA, and our target will be at the recent swing low. Let's look at another example. Here, the stochastic RSI crossed the 80 level to the downside, indicating a sell signal. Both EMAs are sloped downwards, and the price is also closed below the 50 EMA. All the rules are met on this candle, so we will enter a short trade at the open of the next candle, and I set the stop loss at the most recent swing high, and the target at the recent swing low.  Let's understand the conditions for entering a long trade. Entering a long position is the exact opposite of entering a short position. First, the 50-period moving average must be above the 100-period moving average. Moreover, both moving averages should be sloping upward. Second, the stochastic RSI should cross the 20 level to the upside, which is a buy signal. And finally, the price action must be closed above the 50-period moving average. All the rules are met on this candle. We will open a long order at the open of the next candle. You can set a stop loss on either the 50-period moving average line or recent swing low, depending on which is closest to the entry candle, and our target will be at the recent swing high.  Here, the stochastic RSI crossed the 20 level to the upside, indicating a buy signal, and the 50 EMA is above the 100 EMA, and the price is also closed above the 50 EMA. All the rules are met on this candle, so we will enter a long trade at the open of the next candle, and I set the stop loss at the 50-period EMA, and the target at the recent swing high.

pCmJ8wsAS_w,"In this video, I'm going to show you a trading strategy that works so good I just have to tell you guys. And it involves using Bollinger Bands and RS. It's simple, easy to use, and has a pretty high success rate if you use it correctly. Well, enough talk, let's get straight to it.  The first step for this strategy is setting up the Bollinger bands. If you've never used Bollinger Bands before, you're lucky you clicked this video because this indicator is absolutely incredible and is a great way to find support and resistance levels. So the first thing we want to do is to go to trading view or whatever trading chart platform you use, click the indicators tab, and type in Bollinger Bands. Now, the default settings trading view will give you are nice, but we want to change them for this specific strategy. First thing you want to do is go to the length section and change this value to 30, make sure the standard deviation is set to 2. Then I'm also going to remove the background of the indicator, and change the lines to red. This is all personal preference; you can do whatever you prefer here.  So if you didn't know, this is how Bollinger bands work. The center line is a moving average. So whatever amount the length is, this indicator is going back that many candlesticks and finding the average between them. So for this strategy we are going back 30 candlesticks. The lower and upper lines are standard deviation lines.  Alright, we got the Bollinger Bands setup, now let's add the RSI. To do this, just go to your indicators tab, type in RSI, and then click this top one that says Relative Strength Index.  Now that we have RSI added let's modify the settings a bit. Make sure that the upper band is set to 70, and your lower band is set to 30. Then this length is probably going to be set to 14; make sure to change that to 13 for this strategy. If you haven't used RSI before, it's a great indicator to tell you if a certain security is being overbought or oversold. If the line is above the 70 value, it's being overbought; if the line is below the 30 value, it's being oversold.  Now it's time to pair these 2 indicators together and get some profitable trades going. Make sure you watch the rest of this video because I'm going to explain a crucial tip to make this strategy work just okay, to turn it into a money-making machine.  So there are 2 different strategies you can choose from when using these indicators. Both of these strategies are built around the concept called mean reversion. What's mean reversion, you may ask? Well, mean refers to the word average, and the word reversion means returning to.  So to put it simply, the phrase mean reversion just means returning to the average, which is exactly what we are going to be shooting for with this strategy. So as an example, in most cases, if there is extreme price movement in one direction, whether it's up or down, we can pretty much predict after that big price movement, the price will return back to the average (the moving average right here).  So if the price goes above the upper Bollinger band, we want to enter a short trade. If the price goes below the bottom Bollinger band, we want to enter a long trade. Simple enough, right? Well, if you did this by itself, odds are it wouldn't work too good. That's why we added the RSI earlier.  So as you can see in this example, the price went above or below the Bollinger bands many times giving lots of false signals. So if you went in every time here, you probably lost money.  To solve this issue, we are going to add one more requirement. You can only go in if the RSI hits an extreme value. Meaning, we can only enter a long trade if the price moves below the lower Bollinger band and the RSI goes below the value of 25. For shorting, we will only enter a trade if the price goes above the upper Bollinger band, and the RSI goes over the value of 75.  So as an example here we are looking at Apple, and the price starts going below the bottom Bollinger band here, but at this point in time the RSI is still not where we want it to be. So we wait it out a bit until the line goes below 25, which it proceeds to go down all the way to 20; we enter a long trade at this point, and the price returns to the average just like we predicted it would.  Now there is some crucial information you need to know about this strategy or else it simply just won't work. This next tip I'm about to tell you is the difference between making this strategy profitable or making it a money loser.  Where this strategy has its faults is when the market is moving sideways. For almost all trading strategies when the market is moving sideways, it's a lot harder to predict.  So as an example here, the price goes below the lower Bollinger band, and the RSI is below 25, but the price just keeps on dropping. So if you entered here, you would have an absolute massive loss.  So now I'm going to show you a nice little trick so you know beforehand before these huge price movements even happen. So in this example notice how skinny the Bollinger bands are at this point in time, they are very close together, and there is barely any price movement, and the market is moving sideways. You can also see that the RSI is being very tame and staying in between the purple rectangle and not going above or below the major points we made before. This alone should immediately raise a huge red flag. Most times when the market is like this for a while, when the price does break in a certain direction, it goes in that direction with huge amounts of momentum.  So in these types of examples, you never want to trade trying to catch a falling knife when the price starts to act like this. Let me show you another strategy we can use to help solve this, that works like absolute magic.  Here you can see the price starts to drop to the lower Bollinger band and then reverses. The next time it comes down, it makes a new lower low from the previous low, but something interesting is happening. The RSI made a higher low. So we have price making a lower low, but the RSI is making a higher low. This right here is called divergence and is an absolute great sign to enter a trade, especially if RSI was previously below 25, and the price went below the lower Bollinger band. If this happens, there's an extremely great chance the price will reverse and make a new higher high.  I just showed you how to pair Bollinger bands with RSI and make it a profitable trading strategy. All I ask for in return is if you can take 2 seconds out of your day and like this video. You should also watch my other video where I go over a MACD strategy which gets an 86% win rate, which is absolutely insane when it comes to trading. So go check that out, and I'll see you guys next time.",0.19,"Well, enough talk, let's get straight to it.   This is all personal preference; you can do whatever you prefer here.

rf_EQvubKlk,"This MACD strategy I'm about to show you is one of the highest win-rate strategies you can possibly use in trading. It is very easy to use, works in almost every single market, and most importantly, it makes money. Well, enough talk, let's get straight into it.  The MACD or the Moving Average Convergence Divergence is one of the most popular technical indicators used by traders. Essentially, this indicator uses moving averages to find trends in markets, and it's pretty damn good at it too. Now, if you're an experienced trader, you've probably used or heard about the MACD indicator before. But the MACD indicator by itself is just alright, to be honest. So, make sure you watch this full video to see how I pair it with some other indicators to make it perform so much better.  First things first, let's add the MACD indicator to our chart. To do that...  Now that we have the MACD indicator added, let's make sure we know how the MACD actually works. The MACD is made up of 4 different components: The MACD line, the signal line, the histogram, and the zero line. The MACD line, which is the blue line, in most cases, is usually a 12-day moving average, and the signal line, which is the orange line, is usually a 26-day moving average. Next, we have the histogram, which represents the difference between the MACD line and the signal line. So, for example, the smaller the space between the two lines, the smaller the histogram gets. The bigger the space, the bigger it gets. You can also see once the MACD line crosses above the signal line, the histogram turns green, and if the MACD line crosses below the signal line, it turns red. And finally, we have the zero line, which basically represents the center of the MACD indicator.  Now that we know the 4 components, let's make sure we know how to use them. The MACD indicator is insanely good at finding trends in markets. How you can tell if a chart is about to have an upward trend is by looking for a cross upwards between the MACD line and the Signal line. For example, here, the MACD crosses above the signal line, indicating the chart is in upward momentum, and here, the MACD crosses below the signal line, indicating it's in downward momentum. You can also use the histogram to indicate how much momentum there actually is. So, if the histogram is getting bigger, that means there is an increase in momentum. If it's getting smaller, there is a decrease in momentum.  So how you want to use this indicator is by when the lines cross upward, but only if they cross below the zero line. If they cross and it's above the zero line, you wouldn't enter a trade. It's the same thing with shorting; you only enter a short trade if the lines are crossing downward and are ABOVE the zero line.  So as you can see, this indicator is extremely easy to use. But the problem most traders encounter is that they use this indicator by itself. Let me tell you why this doesn't work. The MACD indicator works extremely well if the market is in a trend. So, for example here, the MACD indicator is doing a great job indicating when the price is about to move upward because the chart is in an upward trend. But here, the price is in a downward trend, but the MACD is still signaling to buy long even though the price is going down.  To fix this issue, for example, if we are trading long, we only want to trade if the market is in an uptrend. You never want to trade against the trend because the odds will always be against you. So, an easy way to figure out if the market is in an uptrend, you simply just need to add a 200-day moving average. To do this...  Once we have the indicator added, you'll just see a single line. If the price is above that line, the market is in an uptrend. If the price is below that line, the market is in a downtrend. So after learning that we only want to buy when the market is in an uptrend if we're going long, of course. If we put all this together, we buy if the MACD lines cross below the zero line mark, and the current price is also above the 200-day moving average. This will guarantee that you are only trading when the market is in an uptrend, which is a very powerful combo. If you wanted to short, you would just do the exact opposite. Make sure the price is below the 200-day average and the MACD lines are crossing downward above the zero line.  So as an example, we would enter a long trade right here because the MACD lines are crossing upward below the zero line, and the current price is above the 200-day moving average. Now what I like to do is set a stop loss below the 200-day moving average so the 200-day almost acts as a wall that the price has to break through to hit my stop loss. Then I like to have a 1.5 profit ratio for my profit target mark. So as you can see, for this example, the strategy worked exactly as we wanted it to, and we made money. But, we can still make this trading strategy even better.  This MACD strategy combined with a 200-day moving average works extremely well only if there is a lot of price movement. Where the strategy starts to get kind of iffy and giving false signals is when the chart starts going sideways and losing momentum. So as you can see here, the chart is moving sideways and lost almost all of its upward momentum, and the MACD is giving lots of false signals. If you traded here, odds are you probably lost money.  To fix this issue, we have to combine the MACD with price action. To do this, identify a key support or resistance where price hits and bounces. So as you can see, the price goes down, hits this point, and reverses upwards. The next step is to wait for the price to hit the same key level again. Once it does, we are expecting the price to bounce off this support and go upwards just like it did before. But as a clear note, just because we made the support and it bounced off this before doesn't mean that it will always do that again. It can easily break through the support and drop lower if it has enough momentum.  If we want to make sure the price is about to change in momentum, that's when we bring out the MACD indicator. So what you would do is make sure the price is above the 200-day moving average. Once the price hits the support made, wait for the lines on the MACD to cross below the zero level, and that's when you enter the trade.  So I just revealed to you how the MACD, 200-day moving average, and using support and resistance levels give an extremely high win rate with this strategy.",0.4,"The MACD is made up of 4 different components: The MACD line, the signal line, the histogram, and the zero line.

hh3BKTFE1dc,"In this video, I'm revealing a simple and profitable trading strategy that is proven to have a high win rate. And at the end of the video, I'm going to show you proof of it having a high win rate by backtesting the strategy 100 times. So without further ado, let's get on with the video.  For this strategy, we are using a combination of three indicators: the stochastic, RSI, and MACD. First, let's start with the stochastic because that will generate our main entry signal.  The stochastic is a very simple-to-use indicator that does a very good job of identifying overbought and oversold levels in the market. It consists of two parts: the blue line, which is called the K percentage, and the orange line, which is called the D percentage.  One of the most common mistakes that traders make when using this indicator is that they're trading the stochastic by itself. So they take a buy position every time the indicator hits oversold, and they take a sell position every time the indicator hits overbought. If you're still using the indicator this way, you will get a very low win rate. Instead, you need to combine the stochastic with other indicators to further confirm your analysis.  So let's move on to the second indicator for our strategy, which is the RSI. The RSI is one of the most famous indicators used in trading, and a popular way of using the RSI is by trading it as an overbought and oversold indicator. However, for this combination strategy, we already have the stochastic to do that job. Having two indicators that give the same signals is quite useless. Instead, we are using the RSI as a trend confirmation indicator.  To do that, first, we need to go to the indicator settings and change both of these levels to 50. So now we have a single line in the middle like this, and the way we use it to confirm a trend is very simple. If the RSI is above the middle line, it means that the price is on an uptrend, so you only take buy positions. And if the RSI is below the middle line, it means that the price is on a downtrend, so you only take sell positions.  Now let's move on to the third indicator, which is the MACD. The MACD is one of the most popular indicators that does a very good job of detecting momentum. A common way of using the MACD is by taking a buy position if the MACD line crosses above the signal line and taking a sell position if the MACD line crosses below the signal line. However, this strategy only works if the market is trending. If the market is moving sideways, the MACD often gives false signals.  So that is why for this combination strategy, we are not going to buy or sell just because the MACD crosses over. Instead, we are using it to give extra confirmation and make sure that the momentum is on our side.  And so, this is how the stochastic, RSI, and MACD strategy works. First, let's start with the entry signal. To identify a buy signal, the first step is you want to look at the stochastic and wait for both the K and D lines to hit oversold. Then you want to use the RSI to confirm the uptrend by making sure that it's above the middle line. The next step is you want to use the MACD to confirm the upward momentum by waiting for the MACD line to cross above the signal line. However, you still need to make sure that both of the stochastic lines still haven't hit overbought yet. And if all the rules were met, you take a buy position.  Let's move on to finding sell signals. Again, the first step is you want to look at the stochastic and wait for both the K and D lines to hit overbought. Then you want to use the RSI to confirm the downtrend by making sure that it's below the middle line. The next step is you want to use the MACD to confirm the downward momentum by waiting for the MACD line to cross below the signal line. And you still need to make sure that both of the K and D lines still haven't hit oversold yet. Once all the rules are met, you take a sell position.  For your exit strategy, if you took buy positions, you want to place your stop loss below the nearest swing low and set your profit target at 1.5 times your stop loss. Similarly, if you took sell positions, you want to place your stop loss above the nearest swing high and set your profit target at 1.5 times your stop loss.  Now, before we backtest this strategy 100 times, let's look at it in full action. In this chart, we can see that both the K and D lines are at oversold, meaning we're going to take a buy position. Then you want to confirm the uptrend by making sure that the RSI is above the middle line. The next step is you want to use the MACD to further confirm the upward momentum by waiting for the MACD line to cross above the signal line. And you still need to make sure that both of the stochastic lines still haven't hit overbought yet. Once all the rules are met, you take a buy position.  Now, for your stop loss, you place it below the nearest swing low and set your profit target at 1.5 times your stop loss.  Let's look at another example. In this chart, we can see that both of the K and D lines are at overbought, meaning we're going to take a sell position. Then you want to confirm the downtrend by making sure that the RSI is below the middle line. The next step is you want to use the MACD to further confirm the downward momentum by waiting for the MACD line to cross below the signal line. And you still need to make sure that both of the K and D lines still haven't hit oversold. Once this happens, you take a sell position.  For your stop loss, you place it above the nearest swing high and set your profit target at 1.5 times your stop loss.  So now I'm going to prove that this strategy actually works by backtesting it 100 times. For this backtest, I'm going to use the EUR/USD 30-minute timeframe with a starting capital of $1,000. And for our money management, we are risking 2% of our total capital per trade, and for each trade, we are using 200 times leverage. By the way, you can download this backtesting tool for free in the description below. So without further ado, let's start backtesting.  And finally, after backtesting the strategy 100 times, the results are in. It took us 134 days to reach 100 trades, and out of those 100 trades, we received a very good win rate of 56%. Our most wins in a row was five, and our most losses in a row was three. In total, we made a profit of $280.41, which equates to around 28% overall gain of our $1,000 capital.  So after backtesting, I discovered a couple of optimization and changes that you can implement to further increase the win rate for the strategy. The first one is limiting your stop loss. So normally, if you're taking a sell position, you want to set your stop loss at the nearest swing high. However, in this particular trade, you can see that the swing high is too far away from the price. Therefore, your risk will be too large, and it can potentially give you a massive loss. That is why I recommend limiting your stop loss to only 0.15%. So no matter how far your stop loss is, your loss will never exceed 0.15%.  Another tip that you can use is don't open a new position if you haven't closed your previous one. Let me explain. If you're taking a position, you only exit a trade if the price either hits your stop loss or profit target. However, there are times where the trade takes a long time to hit a target, and as a result, you will miss a couple of entry signals along the way. Which is perfectly fine. I recommend sticking to only one trade at a time because managing more than one trade is very hard.  So I just revealed to you a very simple high win rate strategy that you can immediately use right now.
